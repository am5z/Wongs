# Wongs
This is a simple script that allows you to mass deploy Pterodactyl nodes... or just 1 if you are too lazy to do it manually. It probably won't work on anything other than Debian, Zorin, Ubuntu and so on (Debian based distros) - but it's really not hard to edit 1 line of code to change the package manager.

## Usage

It's 1 line, assuming you have Node.js installed and are in the correct directory. Probably a good idea to configure the `settings.json` file beforehand too.
```
node .
```

And you are done. The only manual part of this is the DNS records, although I'll probably make it use CF to make a record too eventually.
